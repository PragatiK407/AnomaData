# AnomaData
(Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance)
Many different industries need predictive maintenance solutions to reduce risks and gain actionable insights through processing data from their equipment.
Although system failure is a very general issue that can occur in any machine, predicting the failure and taking steps to prevent such failure is most important for any machine or software application.
Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing online monitoring. The goal is to perform maintenance before the equipment degrades or breaks down.
This Capstone project is aimed at predicting the machine breakdown by identifying the anomalies in the data.
**The Dataset** : A copy of the dataset has been uploaded on this repository  https://github.com/PragatiK407/AnomaData/blob/main/Copy%20of%20AnomaData.xlsx
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict machine breakdown by detecting anomalies using a binary classification model...

## Running the Code
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the EDA notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb`
3. Train the model: `python notebooks/model_training.py`
Deployment Instructions in README.md:
Update your README.md with deployment instructions.


## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Environment
Install the required Python dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Step 2**: Load and Use the Model
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('models/anomaly_detection_model.pkl')

# Load new data
new_data = pd.read_csv('data/new_data.csv')

# Ensure the data is preprocessed the same way
# Example: Feature engineering, scaling, etc.
new_data['hour'] = pd.to_datetime(new_data['time']).dt.hour
new_data = new_data.drop(columns=['time'])

# Predict anomalies
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Output predictions
print(predictions)
